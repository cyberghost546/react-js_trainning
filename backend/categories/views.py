# Both views below need "categories + how many published stories each
# has", so the query lives in one function instead of being copied.
#
# .annotate() adds a calculated value to every row. Here: how many
# PUBLISHED stories point at this category. 'stories' is the
# related_name on Story.category, and filter=Q(...) means drafts
# don't count. The database does all the counting in ONE query -
# much faster than asking "how many stories?" 52 separate times.
#
# .order_by('id') keeps the order from the seed file. Without it,
# the counting (SQL "GROUP BY") lets the database return rows in
# whatever order it likes - and the header dropdown and footer
# would suddenly change order too.
